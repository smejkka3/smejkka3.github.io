title:  "Why I’m Documenting My Marathon Prep"
excerpt: "After winning the lottery entry to the 2025 Berlin Marathon, I'm documenting my journey — blending marathon training, data analysis, and self-discipline to grow both as a runner and as a data engineer."

Back in 2024, I wrote a blog post about my first half marathon. I’m honestly not sure if anyone read it — maybe not even by accident — but it meant something to me. It was my first real feat of endurance and a first taste of competition. I didn’t quite hit my goal of running it under 2 hours, but I still got a solid time for a first-timer with less preparation than I’d hoped for.

Fast forward to the end of that year: I signed up for the **2025 Berlin Marathon**, not really expecting anything — and somehow, I won the lottery entry. That email hit different. A half marathon? You can kind of wing that. A full marathon? Not even close. It’s a different beast altogether.

That’s when I realized: this time, I want to **do it properly**. Not just train for the marathon, but document the whole process.

## This Isn’t Just About Running

I’ve been training (more or less consistently) since December 2024. That’s almost 8 months now. And even though I haven’t been perfect, something has changed: I’ve started to **see progress**. Not just on the clock (I knocked 10 minutes off my half marathon time between April 2024 and May 2025), but in my mindset too.

This blog is my way of doubling down on that. It’s part training diary, part tech experiment, and part public accountability.

## Why I’m Doing This (and Why I Think It Matters)

There are a few reasons:

- **Writing**: I want to improve my writing skills — for work, for thinking, for clarity.
- **Discipline**: Documenting the process forces me to be more deliberate. It’s easy to skip workouts. It’s harder to skip reflection.
- **Curiosity**: I’m a data engineer. I’ve spent the past 5 years building data pipelines, working with analytics, and automating stuff. Now I have a Suunto watch that exports everything I do into CSV files. You already know what’s coming — I want to analyze it. Automatically. Visually. Transparently. From performance charts to workout logs and CrossFit WOD analysis.
- **Learning**: Lately, I’ve felt stuck in my own field. Not learning new tools, not keeping up with the tech or fitness research like I used to. This marathon prep is a chance to break that rut. I want to apply everything I know — data science, computer vision, automation — to my own fitness. I want to dive into sports science. Learn the why behind heart rate zones, lactate thresholds, VO₂ max, and more.

## What You Can Expect

I’ll post updates on:

- My marathon training progress — both the highs and the breakdowns.
- Visual and data analysis from my runs using Python and open tools.
- Experiments in automating workout logs (like parsing CrossFit WODs from whiteboard photos).
- Thoughts on fitness tech, training theory, and mental game — from a programmer’s perspective.

Some of this will go on the blog, some of it as visual videos on YouTube. No voice. No face. Just data, storytelling, and a bit of creativity.

If any of this resonates — whether you’re into running, programming, or just curious how to merge both — stick around. I’m training for the Berlin Marathon on **September 21, 2025**, and I’ll be posting my full journey from now until race day.

Let’s see how far I can go — in kilometers, in code, and in consistency.
