I"n<p>The project I’m going to be working on is object tracking using LiDAR initially. The algorithm is based on the paper <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mobile/Papers/2015IJRR_wang.pdf">Wang et. al</a> where the main goal is to implement solution for detection and tracking of moving object using 2D laser scanner.</p>

<h2 id="description-of-tasks">Description of tasks</h2>
<p>Robust object tracking and localization is a critical need for autonomous cars, allowing for safe,
intelligent navigation and planning. Cars must be able to perform this task rapidly and accurately,
requiring algorithms with high output frequencies and low false-negative and false positive rates.
While much work has been done on object tracking and localization with full-scale cars, the F1Tenth
Object Tracking project seeks to implement tracking on the F1Tenth autonomous race
car system.</p>

<p>Initially, this project will build on the work of Dominic Zeng Wang, who proposed a
LiDAR-based object tracking system that uses the knowledge of the static local background to help identifying dynamic
objects from static ones in a principled and straightforward way. This project will
implement and test his proposed system on the F1Tenth vehicle, making use of its onboard 2D
LiDAR. Later, I will combine LiDAR-based tracking with visual tracking, in order to increase
the robustness of the system by increasing the signal-noise ratio from the vehicle’s sensors.
Given the restrictions posed by the pandemic, this project will heavily leverage virtual
environments like F1Tenth team’s proprietary gym environment. If possible, we will
attempt to implement the system on the actual F1Tenth car for further real-life testing and
validation.</p>
